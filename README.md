Midterm Project – Prototype
Hide Assignment Information
Instructions
Description
Continuing the process of building a website, you will create a responsive website of at least 3 pages using HTML and CSS based on your website prototype designed for the Design Foundation course. You are welcome to create more pages if you wish. Your homepage should set the brand, layout, look, and feel of your website. Style matters for this assignment so make it look good!

You may create any pages you wish but you are to demonstrate the requirements as listed in the assignment. This will potentially create friction between design priorities and meeting the objectives of the assignment.

As much content as possible should be created by you but please attribute any work that is not yours.

Guidelines and Considerations
Stay on Scope: Stick to the requirements before getting fancy or tackling any additional work
Help Each Other: Help each other by being supportive, testing each other’s work and offering suggestions to help remove roadblocks - DO NOT COPY CODE
Keep it Simple: Try not to get stuck in overly complex fixes and code
Divide and Conquer: Break the problem down into smaller, manageable problems
Pseudocode: Use everyday language to describe the structure, behaviour and style of your solution
All Work is Gradable: Any extra work in your assignment must be implemented correctly and is subject to grading
Validate and Test Often: Testing and validating your code often means not getting stuck trying to fix errors at the last minute.
Requirements
The following requirements must be met in order to complete the assignment successfully:

Create a GitHub repository with the name 'mtm6201-midterm' 
Include the mockup from Design Foundations used to create your site in the images folder
Build a 3-page website. Base the website off of the 3 pages mockup you created in Design Foundation. If you wish to do a different website please contact the professor when the project is handed out.
You will need to create the HTML, CSS, and any required assets.
Your HTML and CSS should be valid and well-formatted.
Comments should be provided in the HTML and CSS explaining what your code does and why you chose to use it.
Your site should be functional and visually appealing across multiple browsers.
Your site should respond to different screen sizes. CSS grid, flexbox, or any combination of the two may be used to create the layout of the page.
No specific media queries and breakpoints are required but should be used as necessary.
All images on the site should be optimized for web use, and responsive image techniques should be incorporated.
At least two noticeable animations should be used to enhance the overall user experience of the site, with at least one using the animation property.
